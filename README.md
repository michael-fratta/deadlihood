Version 2 of 'Deadlihood - how deadly is your neighbourhood?' includes additional features such as tooltips and a postcode lookup. All data is obtained via the ONS (Office for National Statistics) API, and calculations are run to obtain total number of deaths, as well as mortality rates for all administrative areas of England and Wales. Developed for an end of degree project - module TM470 - for a BSc Hons in Computing and IT with The Open University. Work in progress.
