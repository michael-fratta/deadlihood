Weekly deaths statistics lookup tool. All data is obtained via the ONS (Office for National Statistics) API, and calculations are run to obtain total number of deaths, as well as mortality rates for all administrative areas of England and Wales. Postcode lookups achieved via Postcodes.io.

Initially developed for an end of degree project - module TM470 - for a BSc Hons in Computing and IT with The Open University.

Other details:

• cross-platform (though not optimised for iOS or Web) - being it was developed using React Native; in the Expo managed workflow environment

• requires no device permissions

• stores no data - be it on a user's device, or in a database

• includes internet connection status listeners for error handling

• uses and combined two APIs - the ONS API and the postcodes.io API

• contains all-original artwork (including a GIF) - designed by myself

This is an entirely solo project.
